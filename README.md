# RSE Competencies Framework

This repository was created from a Software Sustainability Institute Collaborations Workshop 2023 Hack Day.

The idea is to construct a resource that is for the RSE community and curated by the RSE community.

**We need your support to get this project to a stage where it can be tested - [see how to contribute](#support-needed)!**

## About

![Screenshot of competency visualisations](rse-forge-screenshot.png)

RSE Competencies Toolkit is a resource to support RSEs (Research Software Engineers) in tracking and managing their
professional development. It is currently in the early stages of development and we welcome contributions and feedback.

Note that, while we've focussed on RSE during the early stages of development, this tool can be used for any roles. We
plan to extend this to other research roles and welcome contributions and collaboration from anyone working in research,
broadly defined.

RSE Competencies Toolkit comprises:

1. An RSE competency framework, outlining a structured **set of skills** that are useful when working as an RSE, with
   examples of how these skills can be demonstrated at different **levels of experience**. Not all RSEs will or need to have
   all skills at all levels.
2. A curated set of training resources, linked to the skills and levels from the competency framework.
3. A tool to visualise and compare different competency profiles.

RSE Competencies Toolkit aims to support the following uses:

1. Recording and visualising your competency profile as an individual RSE.
2. Comparing competency profiles across a group of RSEs (e.g. to show the commonalities and variety across RSEs doing
   the same role at the same level at the same organisation, or comparing across organisations).
3. Find high-quality training resources to improve skills in a particular competency.
4. Define aspirational competency profiles, illustrate the gap to your current profile and highlight training resources
   that could help bridge that gap.

### Current Status

- [x] Initial Research
- [ ] Initial Development <-- We are Here
- [ ] Minimum viable product
- [ ] Alpha Release
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release

### Support Needed

We need support and feedback in the following areas. Contributions of all sizes are welcome.

#### RSE competency framework

##### Defining the skill set

We have a [draft framework](./_data/skills.json) and a [GitHub issue to track
suggestions](https://github.com/RSEToolkit/rse-competencies-toolkit/issues/39).

If you think skills are missing, needs clarification, or could be reorganised within the framework, please add your
feedback to the [GitHub issue to track suggestions](https://github.com/RSEToolkit/rse-competencies-toolkit/issues/39).

##### Defining the skill levels

We have a [draft document on skill
levels](./skill-levels.md) and a [GitHub issue to track
suggestions](https://github.com/RSEToolkit/rse-competencies-toolkit/issues/62).

#### Developing the website

The [website](https://rsetoolkit.github.io/rse-competencies-toolkit/) is currently a basic proof of concept developed
during the CW23 Hack Day. We need support to develop a website that can:

- Show descriptions of all the skills.
- Display and link the professional development resources curated for each skill.
- Allow people to score their own skills and view their skill wheels.

#### Curating professional development resources

We have a file with [resources for professional development](./_data/resources.csv) mapped to skills in the framework.

If you would like to suggest resources to add to the collection, please add them to the [GitHub issue on
curation](https://github.com/RSEToolkit/rse-competencies-toolkit/issues/44).

#### All GitHub issues

Anyone is welcome to contribute suggestions, feedback, and/or PRs to address any open issues. You can also open a new
issue if your idea is not yet mentioned anywhere else.
